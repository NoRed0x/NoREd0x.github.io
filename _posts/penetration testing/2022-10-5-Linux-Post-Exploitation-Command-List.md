In regards to gathering information related to Privilege Escalation,
once access to a host has been obtained there are several subcategories we can use to distinguish the different types of
information we will gather. 



* System 
* Network Information
* User Information
* Privileged Access / Cleartext Credentials
* Services
* Jobs/Tasks
* Installed Software Version Information


## System 

Hostname

`hostname`

 Kernel Version
 
`uname -a`

Operating System

```
cat /etc/issue
cat /etc/*-release
cat /etc/lsb-release
cat /etc/redhat-release
  ```

Running Processes

`ps auxw`


## Network Information

IP address

`ifconfig`

Network Routes

`route -n`

 network configuration settings? What can you find out about this network? DHCP server? DNS server? Gateway?

```
cat /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/sysconfig/network
cat /etc/networks
iptables -L
hostname
dnsdomainname
```

Arp Cache

`arp -a`

Current Network Connections

`netstat -auntp`


## User Information

Current user permissions

` find / -user username`

• UID and GID Information for all users

` for user in $(cat /etc/passwd |cut -f1 -d":"); do id $user; done
`

• Last logged on users

 `last -a`

• Root accounts

`cat /etc/passwd |cut -f1,3,4 -d":" |grep "0:0"  |cut -f1 -d":" |awk '{print $1}'`

## Privileged Access / Cleartext Credentials

Sudo

`sudo -l`

 read the shadow file? If so, can we crack any of the hashes
 
 ` cat /etc/shadow`
 
 ## Services
 
  services are configured on the system and what ports are they opening
  
  `netstat -auntp`
  
  service configuration files readable or modifiable by our current user
  
  `find /etc/init.d/ ! -uid 0 -type f 2>/dev/null |xargs ls -la`
  
  e configuration files contain any information we can use to our advantage
  
  ` cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf`
  
  we stop or start the service as our current user
  
  `service service_name start/stop`
  
  ## Jobs/Tasks
  
  tasks or jobs is the system configured to run and at
which times

` cat /etc/crontab`

`ls -als /etc/cron.*`

any custom jobs or tasks configured as root that
world-writable

`find /etc/cron* -type f -perm -o+w -exec ls -l {} \;`

## Installed Software Version Information

t software packages are installed on the system

`dpkg -l`
