In regards to gathering information related to Privilege Escalation,
once access to a host has been obtained there are several subcategories we can use to distinguish the different types of
information we will gather. 



* System 
* Network Information
* environmental variables
* User Information
* Cleartext Credentials
* Services
* Jobs/Tasks
* Installed Software Version Information


## System 

Hostname

`hostname`

 Kernel Version

```
uname -a
uname -mrs
dmesg | grep Linux
ls /boot | grep vmlinuz-
```

Operating System

```
cat /etc/issue
cat /etc/*-release
cat /etc/lsb-release
cat /etc/redhat-release
```

Running Processes

`ps auxw`


## Network Information

IP address

`ifconfig`

Network Routes

`route -n`

 network configuration settings? What can you find out about this network? DHCP server? DNS server? Gateway?

```
cat /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/sysconfig/network
cat /etc/networks
iptables -L
hostname
dnsdomainname
```

Arp Cache

`arp -a`

Current Network Connections

`netstat -auntp`

users & hosts are communicating with the system

```
lsof -i
lsof -i :80
grep 80 /etc/services
netstat -antup
netstat -antpx
netstat -tulpn
```
## environmental variables
```
cat /etc/profile
cat /etc/bashrc
cat ~/.bash_profile
cat ~/.bashrc
cat ~/.bash_logout
env
set
```
## User Information

Current user permissions

` find / -user username`

• UID and GID Information for all users

` for user in $(cat /etc/passwd |cut -f1 -d":"); do id $user; done
`

• Last logged on users

 `last -a`

• Root accounts

`cat /etc/passwd |cut -f1,3,4 -d":" |grep "0:0"  |cut -f1 -d":" |awk '{print $1}'`

##  Sensitive data 


 sensitive files can be found
 
```
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/group
cat /etc/shadow
ls -alh /var/mail/
cat /var/apache2/config.inc
cat /var/lib/mysql/mysql/user.MYD
cat /root/anaconda-ks.cfg

```

private-key information

```
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
cat ~/.ssh/identity.pub
cat ~/.ssh/identity
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_config
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
```

log files
```

cat /var/www/logs/access_log
cat /var/www/logs/access.log
cat /etc/httpd/logs/access_log
cat /etc/httpd/logs/access.log

cat /var/log/yum.log
cat /var/run/utmp

```
 
 ## Services
 
  services are configured on the system and what ports are they opening
  
  `netstat -auntp`
  
  service configuration files readable or modifiable by our current user
  
  `find /etc/init.d/ ! -uid 0 -type f 2>/dev/null |xargs ls -la`
  
 configuration files contain any information we can use to our advantage
  
  ` cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf`
  
  we stop or start the service as our current user
  
  `service service_name start/stop`
  
  ## Jobs/Tasks
  
 tasks or jobs is the system configured to run and at which times

`cat /etc/crontab`

`ls -als /etc/cron.*`

any custom jobs or tasks configured as root that world-writable

`find /etc/cron* -type f -perm -o+w -exec ls -l {} \;`

## Installed Software Version Information

software packages are installed on the system

```
ls -alh /usr/bin/
ls -alh /sbin/
dpkg -l

```
